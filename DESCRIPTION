Description: The purpose of this package is to discover the genes that
        are differentially expressed between two conditions in RNA-seq
        experiments. Gene expression is measured in counts of
        transcripts and modeled with the Negative Binomial (NB)
        distribution using a shrinkage approach for dispersion
        estimation. The method of moment (MM) estimates for dispersion
        are shrunk towards an estimated target, which minimizes the
        average squared difference between the shrinkage estimates and
        the initial estimates. The exact per-gene probability under the
        NB model is calculated, and used to test the hypothesis that
        the expected expression of a gene in two conditions identically
        follow a NB distribution.
